# React Native Typescript Starter

Simple React Native starter project for TypeScript. Your typical Redux Counter-app, now with typing!

Made possible by the great work of @ds300 who landed a custom source extension PR in RN 0.45. He also made the [react-native-typescript-transformer](https://github.com/ds300/react-native-typescript-transformer) needed to transform the TypeScript for the RN packager. So hats off for him!
